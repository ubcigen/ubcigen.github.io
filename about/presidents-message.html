		Hello, and welcome to the Integrated Engineering (IGEN) Student Website! My name is Gabriel Lessard-Kragen, and I am your President for the 2015/2016 academic term. This website is a virtual hub for Integrated Engineering Students; here you will find information on your classes, projects both past and present, as well as a variety of resources to help you succeed in all your IGEN endeavors.
		</p>
		<p>
		As President of the Integrated Engineering Student Council, it is my job to manage the various council portfolios to best serve the student body, represent our students to the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) and the Alma Mater Society (AMS), and help guide the vision of our department so that Integrated Engineering continues to grow and improve. Our council is a group of exceptional students who are motivated about improving the program, and who manage everything from events, to our club space, to this very website. Please feel free to ask them questions about what they do, they are all incredibly passionate about IGEN and would be happy to discuss their role and the program as a whole. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I wish you the best of luck in your coming year and all the years remaining in your education. Should you have any questions, I would love to help. Please email me and Iâ€™ll be sure to get back to you. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Best wishes,<br><br>
		<strong>Gabriel Lessard-Kragen</strong><br>
		Integrated Engineering President
