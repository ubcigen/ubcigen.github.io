			Hello current and prospective IGEN students, and welcome to our website! I’m Quinn Richardson and I’ll be your President for the 2016/17 academic year. This is your one-stop-shop for information regarding all that is Integrated Engineering at UBC. If you’re unsure about the direction you’ll take in the program, or want information regarding specific classes, look no further!
		</p>
		<p>
			As your Integrated Engineering Student Council President, I provide direction to council regarding how to best serve students. I also represent the program at the Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) and Alma Mater Society (AMS). Along with your council executives we manage the student spaces, events, Facebook groups, and this website. Any one of us would be more than happy to answer question or address concerns that you may have.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope you find the program gives you the tools you need to succeed in your academics and careers. You truly have the freedom to maximize the value of your degree.
		</p>
		<p>
		Best regards,<br><br>
		<strong>Quinn Richardson</strong><br>
		Integrated Engineering President
