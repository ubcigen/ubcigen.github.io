<h2>A Partnership Opportunity</h2>

<p>
In 1919, when French hotelier Raymond Orteig offered $25,000 to whoever could complete the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris, he could not have imagined that it would take eight years and more than $400,000 before someone — Mr. Charles Lindbergh — was able to claim the prize. Over the past century, many similar prizes have been set up to address the most challenging technological problems in society.</p>

<p>
Our IGEN students are capable of solving such problems and are eager for the opportunity to show the world what they can do. The IGEN Challenge is a prize competition intended to provide them with that opportunity. Given an unsolved technical problem, our IGEN students form teams and, over the eight-month academic year, work to solve the problem. We give them course credit for trying, and a monetary prize if they can solve it.
</p>

<p>
This is where our industry partners come in. Industry partnerships represent one of the many ways that the Faculty is able to support and augment such ground-breaking curricular developments. We are working side-by-side with members of industry to solve their specific technical problems through the IGEN Challenge — industry partners set a Challenge by submitting their problems to student teams, cover the project costs, and donate the prize money to the winning teams.
</p>

<p>
The benefit to our industry partners is substantial — for minimal cost, they receive significant manpower hours from the IGEN students, they are able to take advantage of innovative ideas supplied by the next generation of engineering minds, and they derive valuable solutions to their technical problems at a fraction of the cost of dealing with them in-house with paid employees.
</p>

<p>
Industry partners retain full rights to any intellectual property obtained during the Challenge. Not only do our industry partners receive significant value for their dollar, they also benefit from an enhanced exposure and profile on UBC’s campus and amongst UBC Engineering students. This includes exposure on competition documents and the website, as well as at the launch event, and the opportunity to meet the participating teams and other IGEN students at an annual IGEN Project Showcase event and industry night in April.

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>
An Advisory Committee composed of both academic and industry representatives oversees the IGEN Challenge, helping to establish the detailed scope and criteria for the challenges, contributing to decisions on the challenges, documenting the rules, and judging the outcomes. The Committee also works with Industry partners to identify the winning student team: either by rewarding the team that solves the problem completely or, failing that, the team with the solution that best meets certain specific criteria. If no team solves the problem or meets the pre-determined criteria, no prize is awarded.
</p>
<p>
The IGEN Challenge was launched in the fall of 2013, with the initial challenge open to 2nd, 3rd and 4th year students in the IGEN program. IGEN plans to continue to expand the Challenge in the future by extending the program to all students in UBC Engineering.
