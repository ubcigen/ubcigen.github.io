        <title>IGEN CEO Speaker Series: Darby Kreitz</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/images/DarbyKreitz1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Darby Kreitz addressing IGEN students&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IGEN 340 hosted renowned entrepreneur Darby Kreitz for a CEO Speaker Series talk.
The event took place in Frank Forward 303.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darby Kreitz is the CEO of Allnorth Consultants Ltd, a company with just 4 people in 1995 to over 550 people today. Kreitz gave a talk on his background, his leadership style and the importance of choosing a good team to work with. A highlight from his talk was how he chooses “&lt;strong&gt;Attitude over Aptitude&lt;/strong&gt;”: Insisting that while it is important to have good technically minded people on the team, it is even more important that people can fit well together and work as a unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/images/DarbyKreitz2.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Darby Kreitz addressing IGEN students&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He proposes his famous “&lt;strong&gt;four hour pickup truck test&lt;/strong&gt;” as a way to hire people, saying that when you want someone on the team, think about whether you can enjoy a 4 hour long pickup truck ride with them. If the answer is no, you probably don’t want to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IGEN is grateful to Mr Darby Kreitz for presenting today and Mr Mark Dance, IGEN 340 instructor, for facilitating the CEO Speakers Series.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>President&#39;s Update for October 26 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super short updates this week…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grad-photos&quot;&gt;1. Grad Photos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For grads who have not yet taken their photos yet, the last official IGEN session is tomorrow from 9am to 6pm. If you wish to sign up for this time slot, please call Evangelos ((604) 731-8314) and schedule a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After tomorrow, you will need to schedule a photo session yourself. UBC requires that grad photos must be done as a requirement to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuition-consultation&quot;&gt;2. Tuition Consultation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university is raising international tuition drastically. This has significant ramifications for all students, and is an important moment in the school’s history. Be part of the discussion by attending a information session and have your voice heard!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/1492184164410796/&quot;&gt;Facebook Events &amp;amp; Dates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electrical-shop-access&quot;&gt;3. Electrical Shop Access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to feedback from the student body we have changed the policy on the electrical shop: from now on all IGEN students have access to the space with their key card. Please note that should any tools go missing or the space become cluttered this decision will be reversed. Thanks for your co-operation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IGEN is looking for a media team</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1417577354685-3ab67e9716a3?q=80&amp;amp;fm=jpg&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=1941c278eb1c4c1edbd21330af2013d9&quot; alt=&quot;media&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello IGENeers! My name is Darshan Soni and I am your webmaster. I want to welcome you to our brand new website. Stay tuned here as we get a new logo and brand identity over the course of this term. This site is a great tool for you to access information on what’s happening in IGEN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;would-you-like-to-be-a-part-of-the-new-igen-media-team&quot;&gt;Would you like to be a part of the new IGEN media team?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IGEN students club is in the process of revamping all it’s media: website, photo collection, blogs and publications. Over the next few months, this website will grow into a comprehensive hub for all IGEN material. The aim is to be a good student resource that lists information, showcases our projects and appeals to both prospective students and industry members to show off IGEN to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this requires a team effort and so we are looking for budding photographers, bloggers and media fans in general. If you’d like to get involved in creating content for the website, &lt;strong&gt;please&lt;/strong&gt; get in touch with me as soon as possible. Good photography will allow us to get a record of you beauties at all our events, bloggers will release updates that keep our students tuned in to whats happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-in-it-for-you&quot;&gt;What’s in it for you?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well apart from the fact that you’re contributing to the IGEN brand refreshment and making the club even more accessible, there are a few more pros you get by joining the media team:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop your photography / blogging skills by getting more exposure and experimentation space with this website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn awesome skills with HTML, JavaScript, SASS and the Bootstrap Framework.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add this exciting project to your resume.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grow with the project as you go through your degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-much-involvement-is-there&quot;&gt;How much involvement is there?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The involvement will depend on the roles you take up and how you wish to work. IGEN wants to empower it’s students and give them the creative space to develop this space further. Any contributions are welcome and you can mould your roles to what you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alright-lets-do-this&quot;&gt;Alright! Let’s do this!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, contact me with a facebook message or email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New IGEN Site</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1429051883746-afd9d56fbdaf?fit=crop&amp;amp;fm=jpg&amp;amp;h=675&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=1375&quot; alt=&quot;Website Coding&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new IGEN site! 
The site was redesigned with our students, alumni and prospective students in mind. In the last few years, a lot of effort went into creating a site and collecting resources for students online. This spawned our famous Google Drive, the mentorship program and online forms. We tip our hats off to those who invested their time and efforts into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after some time it was evident that IGEN needed a facelift. We are now a well established stuent club and our growth was being hampered by the lack of a cohesive, student run website. This summer, work has been done to rebuild the site. Although the framework is now complete, the new site depends on &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to contribute and build it so that we have a continuously growing student-centred information base that stands the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to IGEN, welcome to the new integratedengineers.ca site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any questions on site management, comments and complaints please feel free to contact the webmaster, Darshan Soni. You can email in at site@integratedengineers.ca&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darshan Soni,
Webmaster&lt;/p&gt;
