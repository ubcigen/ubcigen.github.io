	<h2>Get mentored</h2>
	<p>The mentorship program is a unique component in IGEN that allows second year students to ge paired up with a senior mentor who is majoring in an area of their interest. This gives second year students an insight into their intended area of study and a guide to navigating that particular major.</p>
	<p>To get started, sign up to be mentored below. Note that this is not a homework help service or a tutorial for specific courses. The idea is to get guidance on majors within the program. For homework help please refer to the AMS Services available or the Math LSK building.</p>
