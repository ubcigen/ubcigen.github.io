<h3>Tell us a bit about yourself</h3>

Originally from Norway, I came to UBC to look for a new adventure. Since becoming part of the IGEN community in 2011, I specialized in Mechanical and Software Engineering. I was involved with a number of things on campus that really changed my path going forward. One of them was UBC SailBot, an engineering student team, and the other was the entrepreneurship community at UBC. I met some of the brightest minds I have ever met throughout my time at UBC, and it was from meeting those people and being exposed to a community of innovation that I decided to pursue the future of transportation with Spare, a company I founded shortly after graduating from UBC.
<br><br>
<h3>Tell us about Spare</h3>
With the technology and business models being developed right now, shared mobility is looking to disrupt the transportation industry. There are incredible opportunities for new transportation modes that sit between private car ownership and public transit. We have only seen the beginning — currently 4% of all miles travelled are shared, but in only 15 years this number will increase by over 500% ! (Source: Shared Mobility on the Road to the Future, Morgan Stanley Research, 2016).
<br><br>
Spare started from this need to change the face of shared mobility, making a beautiful product people want to use. Spare Rides is a mobile carpooling platform that connects drivers and passengers with similar routes and interests. It’s the first mobile-enabled carpooling service where you join a trip with only one tap. We accomplish this with a unique guaranteed-trip structure. This is carpooling for the 21st century!
<br><br>
<h3>Major involvements on campus</h3>

My most valuable activity during my time at UBC was my involvement in UBC SailBot. I was named Top 24 Under 24 for growing this highly skilled engineering student team 10 fold, winning international competitions every year since becoming team captain, and creating the team’s latest challenge - a world record attempt in autonomous ocean crossing.<br><br>

<h3>Any advice to current IGEN students?</h3>

<p>Care less about school, and get involved with one or two projects you are passionate about, and contribute a lot of time to this. Get involved with people interested in doing amazing things together, and then work on hard problems! Never become too comfortable with what you are doing.</p><br><br>
