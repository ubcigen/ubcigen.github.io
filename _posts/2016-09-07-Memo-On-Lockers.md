Good Morning IGEN!

Hope you all are enjoying your first day of classes! Please note that all of your personal belongings and your lock must be removed from the lockers in the IGEN clubroom by Friday September 9, 2016. If your lock is not removed, it will be cut and your belongings taken out.

Sign-ups for lockers by term(s) will be posted by Hailey Grotkowski, our VP Internal, on Monday September 12, 2016. Lockers will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis. Please see the price schedule below:

* 1 Term Rental (September to December): $5

* 2 Term Rental (September to April): $10
