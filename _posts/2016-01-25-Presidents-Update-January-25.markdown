Hello all,

I hope you're all having a wonderful Monday and are getting psyched up for e-week! Sorry for the long list, but **please read everything here, there is important stuff.** Without any further ado, here are your updates:


### 1. IGEN Industry Night

The IGEN Project Showcase will be held on April 6th, in the West Atrium of the Life Science Centre. The purpose of this event is to showcase your year long projects, and the IGEN program to professors, parents, and members of Industry. If would like to invite any members of industry, professors or your parents please follow the link below:

### 2. E-week signup

IGEN! E-Week is almost upon us! Please sign up for events on the following google doc. There are events for everyone, so get a group of friends together and go for it!

For the social events, put your name down for the ones you're interested in so that you can see which of your friends are interested in going! This year IGEN has a great opportunity to not only fight for the the title of E-Week champs, but also to put our best foot forward as the brightest up-and-coming program in the faculty.


### 3. Old Red New Red

This event is getting a huge face-lift this year, so you need to sign-up in advance! I highly recommend you take this opportunity to network with alumni.

### 6. Iron Ring information session

The info session will be held on Feb 25th, 1:30-2:30pm at the Norm Theatre in the Old SUB.

At the sessions Camp 5 Wardens will provide valuable information regarding procedure at the Ceremony and the history and tradition of the Iron Ring. Attendance is mandatory;  and anyone who is unable to attend a Briefing Session due to a legitimate critical alternate commitment only, must appoint a class-mate to take notes on their behalf.

1:45 pm | All students seated / presentation starts

### 7. Upper year project mentorship

The IGEN council is searching for up to 10 3rd of 4th year students to help with the IGEN 230 class. Your role would be to help mentor a second year project group, providing advice for sourcing, industry night, and any other resources that they may need. This is very flexible and is an awesome way to meet more students in our department! If interested please email me at igenpresident@gmail.com. We already have a few people, but the more the merrier!


### 8. Sports apparel

IGEN will be doing athletic tops for the next IGEN apparel order. There are a few options (see attached document) so if you are interested please fill out the facebook poll (in the IGEN Group) and indicate which option(s) you would like and what color (black, red, white). After one week we will take all the feedback and determine which option we are going to order. The cost will be around $15

### 9. Personal branding workshop

This event will pair you with an experienced older student who can give you a hand with your resume, cover letter, interview skills, LinkedIn, you name it. The idea is to help you tailor your applications to best achieve the positions you want. This is a super valuable opportunity, and can push you towards success. Come on out this Wednesday, January 27th, from 5-7PM in the IGEN clubroom.

### 10. First Aid course

So you may have seen a signup sheet in the IGEN clubroom last semester for an Emergency first aid course coming to certify IGEN students. We have set a date for this on February 27th from 9:00 to 5:00 on UBC campus (exact room to be determined) and will cost $85. If you are interested and would like to sign up or get more information, please send me an email at lance.cburnett@gmail.com.

The certification is Emergency First Aid with CPR/AED Level C.
Students outside of IGEN are welcome to join, however we would like to give IGEN students the opportunity to sign up first (there are limited seats) so please wait until Wednesday (January 27) before inviting them.
