Much of the world doesn't have the privilege to contribute to the choice of who leads their nation. Take this opportunity to have your say and be part of the bigger picture.

### 2.Krispy Kreme Fundraiser

We're having a Krispy Kreme fundraiser! Help IGEN raise funds for our industry outreach, club room and student affairs by boothing in Kaiser on Oct 26 - 28th anytime between 11-3pm. Even if it's just 30 mins or a couple of hours, your help is greatly appreciated :)

Please email Jael at lumbajael@gmail.com with your name, phone number, and date & time of availability to booth.

### 3. Sports

IGEN came third at the EUS Ultimate Tournament! Big thanks to Lance Burnett for organizing our team, and IGEN's own Alex Hutchinson for organizing the event!

### 4. Social Night

This Friday (October 23rd) starting at 5PM come out to Koerner's on campus and enjoy a drink with other Integrated Engineers. This is a great way to take the load off of midterms.

### 5. Project Forum

This will take place October 24th, at 1PM in the IGEN Clubroom. This is an opportunity for groups to outline and discuss their projects with each other for feedback, as well as to give the other students an idea of what they will be working on for the year. Need help with a certain topic related to your project? Chances are someone in IGEN will be able to help. This is also a great opportunity for the 2nd years to get an idea of what kind of projects are to be expected!
