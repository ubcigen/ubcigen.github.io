Good afternoon everyone,

I hope you all had a wonderful reading break and are feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the end of the school year! For those graduating, you're almost there! This week we have some very important things that MUST be filled out in the next week, so please read carefully. Without further ado, here are the updates.


### 1. Industry Night Student Listing - very important

As with last year, we are preparing a list of all of our students and their year of study to put in a pamphlet for Industry Night. The idea is that this list will help potential employers see who is in the program and will allow sponsors a platform to present themselves to the student body. WE NEED EVERYONE'S FULL LEGAL NAME AND YEAR OF STUDY. If you do not want to be in the brochure, please email me with a reason. Your year of study should correspond to the project course you are enrolled in, i.e. the max is 4th. You do not want to be the one person not in the brochure when a recruiter takes it home.

### 2. IGEN Industry Night - Invite List - very important

The IGEN Project Showcase will be held on April 6th, in the West Atrium of the Life Science Centre.
