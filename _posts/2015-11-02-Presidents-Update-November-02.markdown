Good morning,

Here are a few updates for you all:

### 1. Academic Consulatation

This evening all of the year reps and our VP Academic will be representing the department at the EUS Grand Council. There we will be providing feedback regarding our courses and areas for improvement. If you have any constructive feedback regarding our courses and changes you would like to see, please let any of the mentioned people above know, comment on the related Facebook posts, or reply to this email.

### 2. Grad

If you have not yet had your ring sized or paid you gown deposit, please contact Cobi immediately. Also if you did not get your grad photos taken during the set aside blocks you must call Evangelos Photography and arrange your own appointment.

### 3. Bulletin Board

Thanks to Hailey, we have a new bulletin board in the clubroom! The top portion is to be used by IGEN Council for updates, whereas the bottom portion is or you, our students, to make announcements to the department at large. Any inappropriate language or content  will be removed without notice, and after an event has passed the poster will be removed unless otherwise notified.
