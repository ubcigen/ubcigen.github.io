Welcome to the new IGEN site! 
The site was redesigned with our students, alumni and prospective students in mind. In the last few years, a lot of effort went into creating a site and collecting resources for students online. This spawned our famous Google Drive, the mentorship program and online forms. We tip our hats off to those who invested their time and efforts into it.

However, after some time it was evident that IGEN needed a facelift. We are now a well established stuent club and our growth was being hampered by the lack of a cohesive, student run website. This summer, work has been done to rebuild the site. Although the framework is now complete, the new site depends on **you** to contribute and build it so that we have a continuously growing student-centred information base that stands the test of time.

Welcome to IGEN, welcome to the new integratedengineers.ca site. 

For any questions on site management, comments and complaints please feel free to contact the webmaster, Darshan Soni. You can email in at site@integratedengineers.ca

Thank you,

Darshan Soni,
Webmaster
