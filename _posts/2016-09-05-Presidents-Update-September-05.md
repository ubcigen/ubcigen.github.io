Good Afternoon IGEN,

The time is almost upon us! Here's your weekly update:

### Imagine Day (11:15AM tomorrow, September 6)

This will be your chance to meet the incoming IGEN 2's! We'll be welcoming them into the program tomorrow in the clubroom and you'll have the opportunity to talk with them and show them the ropes. There will be pizza and beverages provided. Please note that the food will be primarily for the IGEN 2's.

There will be an IGEN Social in the clubroom afterwards at 6pm with more beverages.

### First Week (September 6-9)

We've got several exciting events happening this week starting tomorrow in the IGEN clubroom:

* Tuesday 6pm: IGEN Social
* Wednesday 7pm: Movie Night
* Thursday 7pm: Trivia and Games
* Friday 6pm: IGEN x TGIF Social

Stay tuned to the IGEN Facebook groups for the details.

### Year Reps

Thanks to those of you who have come forward interested in becoming year reps. If anyone else has an interest in being elected year rep for their respective year (2nd Years, 3rd Years, and Graduate Class), please let me know ASAP. Elections will be held in the the first couple of weeks.

### Intramural Sports Teams

Jason Miller will be posting sign-ups for 1st term teams shortly. Stay tuned!

### Mentorship Program

If you want to be a part of this amazing program that is a huge benefit for incoming 2nd years, please let Connor White know! You'll be paired with an IGEN 230 group to give them advice and help them through the process.
