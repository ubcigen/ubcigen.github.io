<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/spotlight/cobi-yu">Cobi Yu</a></h3>

> "Take the time to make meaningful connections outside the classroom, join a student team/organization, find people who are passionate about the things you are – the relationships you make during university are lifelong."

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/spotlight/gabriel-lessard">Gabriel Lessard-Kragen</a></h3>

> " Throughout an engineering degree, I think you learn not so much what you know, but more what you don’t know."

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/spotlight/john-robert-mackenzie">John Robert MacKenzie</a></h3>

> " There are few problems so insurmountable that they are not worth trying to solve."

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/spotlight/kiel-olver">Kiel Olver</a></h3>

> "Far too many people overvalue material wealth and vanity and many technologies are developed that contribute to that mindset. I want to create technology that improves utility, life experience and relationships."

<h3><a target="_blank" href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/spotlight/sara-flanagan">Sara Flanagan</a></h3>

> " Continuous learning keeps your mind active and keeps you relevant and dynamic. Time spent learning is always time well invested."

Congratulations to our rising stars of 2016. Go IGEN!
