Hello everyone,

I hope you had a wonderful holiday break. This week the update will be short as we get geared back up for school.


### 1. Iron Ring Ceremony

There will be MANDATORY info sessions ~1-2 weeks before the ceremony itself - dates are still being settled. You must attend the info session in order to attend the ceremony. There will be two info sessions, and we will assign each department to one session. Grads must attend the correct session.

The Iron Ring ceremony will be on March 9th. Logistics coming soon, but last year doors opened ~1:30pm and it ran until 4pm.

Yes: this is something you skip class for (both the info session and the ceremony). I will be contacting all professors in APSC and letting them know about the date as soon as possible. Most of the time, profs are pretty good about this - they understand that it is important. 


### 2. E-Week teams

The e-week teams have been made and emails sent out from the various team leaders. If you would still like to be involved with the teams please email Jesse, our e-week coordinator, at jmacht@shaw.ca


Thanks everyone, and welcome back!
