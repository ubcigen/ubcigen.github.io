Hello, my name is Jesse Macht and I am in my fourth year of Integrated Engineering. I am interested in fluid dynamics and controls engineering, so I have taken courses related to these interests through the Mechanical and Electrical departments, respectively. I have worked with design project teams and a local start up on the development of UAV technology for remote sensing applications in industry. I have also been involved in academic research into the lightweight alloys used for modern automotive and energy applications, both at UBC and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.


Besides the academic and industry work I am involved in, I am very invested in engaging Integrating Engineering students on the social side of their degree experience. This year I am the E-Week representative for the Integrated Engineering Council and I am working with both the EUS and the Council to reimagine how we engage socially through E-Week events and activities. Please do not hesitate to contact me regarding E-Week, any of my academic or industry work, or about the IGEN degree in general. I would love to speak with you!
