title: "High Radiation Vacuum Beamline Connection System"
categories: IGEN-Project

<p>The High Radiation Vacuum Beamline Connection System (HRVBCS) will streamline the process of changing vacuum seals and clamping beamlines for TRIUMF's ARIEL project. The HRVBCS will unclamp, remove the used seal from, place a new seal on, and re-clamp the beamline from a vertical distance of two meters. This shortens the seal change time by up to 80%, reducing time employees are exposed to harmful radiation and increasing the accuracy in which the seal is placed.</p>
