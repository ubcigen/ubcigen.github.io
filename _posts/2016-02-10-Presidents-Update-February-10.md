Good morning everyone,

First off thank you everyone for your fantastic enthusiasm for E-Week! We had our highest finish ever, drawing for 4th place. For a small department with so many other things going on that's a great turnout. Special mention to our second years who carried us throughout the week and garnered special mention from the organizers for their good spirit and determination. Also shout out to Lockie Pedersen for his countless hours working on the ball model and chariot, and Jesse Macht, who coordinated the entire effort! Also to Nadia and Cameron for leading the Film and Chariot teams, respectively.
