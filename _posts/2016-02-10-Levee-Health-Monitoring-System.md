<p>
Levee failures are frequent and have catastrophic social, economic, and environmental consequences. What if we could catch shifts in the levee before disastrous failure occurs? The levee health monitoring system does just this by alerting field workers to changes in a levee's three primary modes of failure: seepage, sliding, and erosion. This data is transmitted to a base station, allowing field workers to move beyond the insufficient visual inspections that are currently used in industry.
