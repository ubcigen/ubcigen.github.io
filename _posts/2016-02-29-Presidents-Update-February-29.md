Hello everyone,

Here are your updates. Apologies for the delay, some details for the jackets below were being ironed out.


### 1. IGEN Jackets

I know this has been a long and disappointing process, and trust me when I say no one is more frustrated with the delays on our jackets than I. I have moved distributors as the one we had an agreement with failed to hold up their side of the bargain. We are switching to a split of the Marmot and North Face Venture jacket. The price will now be the same for both, the sizing is the same, and the colour for the North Face will be Mid Grey Heather, which is the closest to the Marmot. We will be randomizing who gets which ones, and then if you want to trade with someone you are free to do so.

If you would like to change your order please feel free to reply, otherwise we will keep your order from earlier and carry it over. Hopefully we can have these by Industry Night!


### 2. Kiewit Seminar

The second installment of the IGEN Seminar Series is here, and it is being lead by Jason Block Of Kiewit. This is a great opportunity to learn about Kiewit, and positions available to both graduating students and students interested in summer positions. There will be a short 40 minute presentation, 10 minutes of questions and ample time for networking. Pizza and pop will be provided! Please follow the link below to find out more about the event:

### 3. IGEN Space cleanup

This year the first year's clubroom crawl will be taking place the day after Industry Night. This means that we need our space to be sparkling clean before Industry Night begins. As part of your requirements before setting up for Industry Night we will need the IGEN Clubroom, shop, and electrical room to be spotless. This means everyone must do their part to help clean up everything. You WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO SET UP UNTIL EVERYTHING IS CLEAN. More details will be released closer to the event.


### 4. Iron Ring After Party

The EUS is hosting an after party for the Iron Ring Ceremony on March 9th! The details can be found in the following facebook event:
