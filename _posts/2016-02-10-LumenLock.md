<p>LumenLock is an integrated medical dressing designed to improve the quality of care for patients who have central venous or peripherally inserted central catheters. Existing medical dressings fail to adequately secure central lines and are not waterproof, often leading to skin irritation due to frequent changes. LumenLock holds the line close to the body and forms a waterproof barrier over the catheter exit site. As a result, patients are less likely to accidentally pull out their lines and fewer dressing changes are required. LumenLock will be sold directly to hospitals, providing a more comfortable, time saving and cost efficient solution. </p>
