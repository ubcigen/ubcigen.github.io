Hello everyone,

Apologies for the late email. This week we have a long list of announcements, including some repeat ones that are vitally important! Please take the time to go over the list carefully to make sure you are aware of all of the opportunities.


### 1. IGEN Seminar Series - Copperleaf

Stan Coleman from Copperleaf will be leading a seminar at IGEN's new Seminar Series! This is a great opportunity to learn about Copperleaf, and the roles that IGEN graduates can take on. There will be a short 30 minute presentation, 10 minutes of questions and ample time for networking. Refreshments will be provided.

Date: February 10th at 5:00 PM
Location: Frank Forward, classroom TBD


### 2. IGEN Industry Night

The IGEN Project Showcase will be held on April 6th, in the West Atrium of the Life Science Centre.

### 3. IGEN Electrical Room cleanup

Currently the electrical room has a ton of loose parts and wire all over the place. The majority of this comes from the second year line following robot projects. Next Tuesday, February 9th, everything from that room will be removed in an effort to hold back the tide of clutter. If you want to keep any parts or pieces, please remove them before the weekend.


### 4. E-Week sign-up

IGEN! E-Week is here! Please sign up for events on the following google doc. There are events for everyone, so get a group of friends together and go for it!
