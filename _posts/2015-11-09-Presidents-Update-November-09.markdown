Good morning,

Here are a couple important announcements for the coming week.


### 1. Krispy Kreme Fundraiser

Krispy Kreme Fundraiser - Help Wanted!

IGEN is growing in numbers each year and we need money to help cover costs for our shop supplies, clubroom, student affairs, and industry outreach. We will be setting up a booth in the Kaiser Atrium from November 23  - 26 (11 am - 2 pm everyday) and will be selling Krispy Kreme donuts for cheap:

$10/dozen, $1/single donut

Help booth, sell donuts and spread the word about IGEN! If you got 30mins to spare, or even more, help would be greatly appreciated! Sign up sheet will be posted on the bulletin in the clubroom.

Invite your friends to the facebook event (and check our new IGEN logo!):
