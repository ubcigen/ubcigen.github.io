Hello returning IGENeers!

I hope you all have had a great summer so far! As we approach the beginning of classes, I wanted to give a quick update on what's coming.

For those of you who don't know me, I'll be the IGEN President for the 2016/17 academic year. If I haven't met you yet I look forward to doing so in the coming weeks!

### First Week and Imagine Day:

Your VP Student Life, Sam Lai, and his team have been hard at work putting together exciting events for our first week back. He'll be posting in the Integrated Engineering Students Facebook page soon with the details, so stay posted.

There will be a meet and greet at IGEN Clubroom on Imagine Day (Tuesday, September 6), food and beverage will be provided. This will be a great chance to meet the incoming IGEN 2's and welcome them to the IGEN family. I'm sure they will have lots of questions. Got your "What's IGEN?" responses ready?

### Year Reps:

Every IGEN year (2nd years, 3rd years, and graduate class) will have an elected representative on the IGEN Council. They will essentially be the voice of their respective years on council and will relay important information to their classmates. The elections will occur within the first few weeks of class, so if you're already interested please let me know.

### Mentorship Program:

Your VP Academic, Connor White, will be overseeing the Mentorship Program. This is extremely helpful for second years as they begin their first year-long projects. Your experience is a great resource for them. A little bit of your time will go a long way. If you're interested in participating, please talk to Connor. If you've been a part of the Mentorship Program in the past, please fill out the following feedback [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWfaDRCzIiJSlJ0A5Ua1NyAfp4lP-wM2d1kFT-PvFF-ofvxQ/viewform?c=0&w=1).

### Intramural Sports Teams:

Jason Miller will be your Sports Rep this coming year. Sign-ups for various intramural sports will be available shortly after the beginning of classes. This is a great way to satisfy your competitive side, maintain fitness, and get to know your fellow IGENeers!

### Security:

Over the summer some equipment from the electrical room went missing and is believed to be stolen. Other department clubrooms have also had break-ins. As a course of action, please refrain from propping open the doors between the computer lab and the electrical room. Anyone who isn't in the program must be accompanied by and IGEN student while in the clubroom space. Also, please do not leave any personal valuables unattended.
