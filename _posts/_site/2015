Happy Monday!

Super short updates this week...

### 1. Grad Photos

For grads who have not yet taken their photos yet, the last official IGEN session is tomorrow from 9am to 6pm. If you wish to sign up for this time slot, please call Evangelos ((604) 731-8314) and schedule a time.

After tomorrow, you will need to schedule a photo session yourself. UBC requires that grad photos must be done as a requirement to graduate.

### 2. Tuition Consultation

The university is raising international tuition drastically. This has significant ramifications for all students, and is an important moment in the school's history. Be part of the discussion by attending a information session and have your voice heard!

### 3. Electrical Shop Access

Due to feedback from the student body we have changed the policy on the electrical shop: from now on all IGEN students have access to the space with their key card. Please note that should any tools go missing or the space become cluttered this decision will be reversed. Thanks for your co-operation.
