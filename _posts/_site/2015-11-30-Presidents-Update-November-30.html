<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>Here are your updates for the last week of school! Stay strong, youâ€™re almost there.</p>

<h3 id="e-week-teams">1. E-Week Teams</h3>

<p>Jesse, our E-Week rep, has posted some preliminary teams on the IGEN Facebook group. The poll is the top pinned post. Please sign up for these groups, as they are an awesome way to use your engineering skills in a fun competition and represent your department!</p>

<h3 id="first-aid-courses">2. First Aid courses</h3>

<p>IGEN is considering bringing in an instructor to teach emergency first aid on Saturday or Sunday in the second week of January. We will hold sessions on both days if there is enough interest. The session is 8 hours and will cost $85. There will be sign up sheets in the clubroom for both days. Please sign up on one of the days to express your interest. A minimum of 15 people is required per session, so if we have less than 15 on a day, then we may combine groups and have one session.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone, and enjoy the week!</p>
