<p>Hello IGENeers! My name is Darshan Soni and I am your webmaster. I want to welcome you to our brand new website. Stay tuned here as we get a new logo and brand identity over the course of this term. This site is a great tool for you to access information on what’s happening in IGEN.</p>

<h4 id="would-you-like-to-be-a-part-of-the-new-igen-media-team">Would you like to be a part of the new IGEN media team?</h4>

<p>The IGEN students club is in the process of revamping all it’s media: website, photo collection, blogs and publications. Over the next few months, this website will grow into a comprehensive hub for all IGEN material. The aim is to be a good student resource that lists information, showcases our projects and appeals to both prospective students and industry members to show off IGEN to the world.</p>

<p>However, this requires a team effort and so we are looking for budding photographers, bloggers and media fans in general. If you’d like to get involved in creating content for the website, <strong>please</strong> get in touch with me as soon as possible. Good photography will allow us to get a record of you beauties at all our events, bloggers will release updates that keep our students tuned in to whats happening.</p>

<h4 id="whats-in-it-for-you">What’s in it for you?</h4>

<p>Well apart from the fact that you’re contributing to the IGEN brand refreshment and making the club even more accessible, there are a few more pros you get by joining the media team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop your photography / blogging skills by getting more exposure and experimentation space with this website.</li>
  <li>Learn awesome skills with HTML, JavaScript, SASS and the Bootstrap Framework.</li>
  <li>Add this exciting project to your resume.</li>
  <li>Grow with the project as you go through your degree.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-much-involvement-is-there">How much involvement is there?</h4>

<p>The involvement will depend on the roles you take up and how you wish to work. IGEN wants to empower it’s students and give them the creative space to develop this space further. Any contributions are welcome and you can mould your roles to what you’d like.</p>

<h4 id="alright-lets-do-this">Alright! Let’s do this!</h4>
