<h3 id="project-forum">5. Project Forum</h3>

<p>This will take place October 24th, at 1PM in the IGEN Clubroom. This is an opportunity for groups to outline and discuss their projects with each other for feedback, as well as to give the other students an idea of what they will be working on for the year. Need help with a certain topic related to your project? Chances are someone in IGEN will be able to help. This is also a great opportunity for the 2nd years to get an idea of what kind of projects are to be expected!</p>
