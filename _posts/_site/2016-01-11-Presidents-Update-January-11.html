<p>Good afternoon everyone,</p>

<p>Here are your notices for this week.</p>

<h3 id="igen-spaces">1. IGEN spaces</h3>

<p>The IGEN areas, specifically the electrical shop and the computer lab, have been getting very cluttered. Please make sure to remove your tools and work after you finish and leave the area as you found it. This is a communal space we are very lucky to have, so please respect it.</p>

<h3 id="igen-shop-supervision">2. IGEN Shop supervision</h3>

<p>The IGEN shop will be creating a new schedule for the semester now that everyoneâ€™s classes have changed. New shop supervisors are welcome, note that shop supervisors are provided card access to the shop at all times. The position requires one or two hours of shop supervision each week. If you would like to become a shop supervisor for this semester please send an email to the shop manager, Lachlan, at lockiepeds1@gmail.com before Wednesday, January 13th.</p>

<h3 id="printer-paper">3. Printer paper</h3>

<p>The printer has been running out of paper quite often. In response we have put extra in the shop locker, please ask the shop supervisor on duty for extra if the printer has run out. Also be sure to print multiple slides per page if printing class notes. We have large boxes of paper on order so hopefully this issue will be resolved.</p>

<h3 id="iron-ring-ceremony">4. Iron Ring Ceremony</h3>

<p>There will be MANDATORY info sessions ~1-2 weeks before the ceremony itself - dates are still being settled. You must attend the info session in order to attend the ceremony. There will be two info sessions, and we will assign each department to one session. Grads must attend the correct session.</p>

<p>The Iron Ring ceremony will be on March 9th. Logistics coming soon, but last year doors opened ~1:30pm and it ran until 4pm.</p>

<p>Yes: this is something you skip class for (both the info session and the ceremony). I will be contacting all professors in APSC and letting them know about the date as soon as possible. Most of the time, profs are pretty good about this - they understand that it is important.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone, and have a lovely week.</p>
