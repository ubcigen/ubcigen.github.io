<h3 id="igen-jackets">2. IGEN Jackets</h3>

<p>Thank you to all who signed up to purchase a jacket. Due to the size of our order they will not be finished until January. Thus, hold tight for payment options and information, as well as expected pickup dates. Thanks for your patience!</p>

<h3 id="eus-football-tournament">3. EUS Football Tournament</h3>

<p>IGEN had to two teams playing this past Sunday in the EUS Flag Football event. Both teams played very well and represented the department with pride. Big shout out to Tanya Bennet, our sports rep for her organization and Alex Hutchinson, EUS VP Student Life for making the whole tournament a reality.</p>

<h3 id="igen-general-meeting">4. IGEN General Meeting</h3>

<p>Thank you to all who came to the General Meeting last friday. Some excellent discussion took place surround e-week and the IGEN Councilâ€™s performance up to this point. As we did not have time to complete our goals discussing future events and initiatives you can expect some polls to appear in the near future on the IGEN facebook pages.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone, and have a fantastic week. This week our photo shows some alternative but no less important applications of engineering knowledge; letting this little cutie walk again!</p>
