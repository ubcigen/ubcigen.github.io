<p>IGEN 340 hosted renowned entrepreneur Darby Kreitz for a CEO Speaker Series talk.
The event took place in Frank Forward 303.</p>

<p>Darby Kreitz is the CEO of Allnorth Consultants Ltd, a company with just 4 people in 1995 to over 550 people today. Kreitz gave a talk on his background, his leadership style and the importance of choosing a good team to work with. A highlight from his talk was how he chooses “<strong>Attitude over Aptitude</strong>”: Insisting that while it is important to have good technically minded people on the team, it is even more important that people can fit well together and work as a unit.</p>

<p>He proposes his famous “<strong>four hour pickup truck test</strong>” as a way to hire people, saying that when you want someone on the team, think about whether you can enjoy a 4 hour long pickup truck ride with them. If the answer is no, you probably don’t want to work with them.</p>

<p>IGEN is grateful to Mr Darby Kreitz for presenting today and Mr Mark Dance, IGEN 340 instructor, for facilitating the CEO Speakers Series.</p>
