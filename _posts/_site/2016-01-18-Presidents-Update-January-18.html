<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>This is a very long update this week as there is a lot of stuff going on. Please read through as there are a number of excellent opportunities to take hold of, and places to get involved. Without further ado, here are your updates:</p>

<h3 id="e-week-signup">1. E-Week Signup</h3>

<p>IGEN! E-Week is almost upon us! Two more weeks until the festivities commence and it is now time to open signup for events and activities. Please see the attached Google Drive folder link for detailed schedules, rules and the all important signup sheets to make sure we know you’re coming to the great events the EUS has planned.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16eIR1f07O3jBWWVbsDXIg6kPhgN6FmjIFXySrS3C2y8">Sign up sheet</a></p>

<p>THESE WILL FILL UP - most of the sport/competition events have a limited number of entries from each department, so as soon as those quotas are met I will close registration for those sections. SIGN UP ASAP!!</p>

<p>For the social events, put your name down for the ones you’re interested in so that you can see which of your friends are interested in going! This year IGEN has a great opportunity to not only fight for the the title of E-Week champs, but also to put our best foot forward as the brightest up-and-coming program in the faculty.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates and we can’t wait to see you during E-Week!</p>

<h3 id="pre-e-week-party">2. Pre-E-Week Party</h3>

<h3 id="blood-drive">4. Blood Drive</h3>

<p>Are you ready to give? It’s time for another EUS blood drive! We are adopting the Oak St. Clinic on January 27th &amp; 28th.</p>

<p>By signing up and donating with us (or giving blood to research if you aren’t qualified to donate!), you can collect charity points and get yourself on your way to earning a Charity Patch for your Red. In addition, you can ALSO earn points for your Department in the Blood Cup! At the end of the year, the Department with the most points will win the coveted Blood Trophy.</p>

<p>Sign up using the form at ubcengineers.ca/blood and check out the Facebook event at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1727498030819830/">Here</a></p>

<p>If you have a group of four or more, please contact Cherise Louie directly at (778) 837-5097 to organize appointments as well as transportation. Larger groups will be able to control their own times so it may be more convenient for you!</p>

<h3 id="faculty-cup">5. Faculty Cup</h3>

<p>The insatiable rumors and word on the malls are true- Faculty Cup is back and bigger than ever! On January 29th, we’re rollin’ out the faculty colours and unleashing those friendly rivalries in UBC’s only faculty vs. faculty competition. Think you’ve got what it takes to be great this coming January? Faculty Cup will be here to put your faculty to the test. For more info and to register go to:
