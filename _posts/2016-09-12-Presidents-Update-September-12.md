Hello IGEN,

Now that the term is ramping up I wanted to update you all with what's going on in IGEN. If you're an IGEN 2, this is your first weekly update!

### Quick Reminders

The door to the electrical room will not shut properly under its own weight, please remember to pull the door shut until this is resolved.
Please do not prop open the doors between the electrical room and the computer lab. This is how equipment gets stolen.
This Tuesday September 13th and Thursday September 15 from 2:00pm to 3:30pm will be orientation periods for the 2nd years. We will require the clubroom, shop, and electrical room to be unoccupied during these periods.

### Year Reps:

**2nd Years:**
Thanks to those of you who have expressed interest in becoming your year rep! Elections will happen during your IGEN 230 lecture this Thursday September 15. If you're interested in becoming 2nd Year Rep, you'll have a brief few minutes to explain why you should represent your peers on the IGEN Council. The election will occur immediately after using the "heads down / hands up" method.

**3rd Years:**
As Kate Mason was the only one to express interest in this position, she will be your 3rd Year Rep.

**Graduate Students:**
We still need a rep for your year! Please let me know ASAP if you're interested in being a rep.

### IGEN Jackets

I still have a few jackets left that haven't been claimed and/or paid for. If you ordered yours before the summer please contact me and I can give yours to you.

### EUS Sustainability Rep

Passionate about sustainability? The EUS (Engineering Undergraduate Society) is looking for reps from each engineering program for their sustainability committee. This is would require a very minimal commitment to the EUS (approx. 3 meetings a term) and you'll have a chance to shape the EUS's sustainability policy for years to come! If you're interested let me know!

### Slack

Tired of using Facebook groups and various forms of groupchats to organize your projects groups? Check out Slack! This project management website was even used by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory! This software integrates forum discussions with file sharing seamlessly to facilitate the development of a group project. Check out the link below.
