IGEN 340 hosted renowned entrepreneur Darby Kreitz for a CEO Speaker Series talk.
The event took place in Frank Forward 303. 


Darby Kreitz is the CEO of Allnorth Consultants Ltd, a company with just 4 people in 1995 to over 550 people today. Kreitz gave a talk on his background, his leadership style and the importance of choosing a good team to work with. A highlight from his talk was how he chooses "**Attitude over Aptitude**": Insisting that while it is important to have good technically minded people on the team, it is even more important that people can fit well together and work as a unit.

He proposes his famous "**four hour pickup truck test**" as a way to hire people, saying that when you want someone on the team, think about whether you can enjoy a 4 hour long pickup truck ride with them. If the answer is no, you probably don't want to work with them.

IGEN is grateful to Mr Darby Kreitz for presenting today and Mr Mark Dance, IGEN 340 instructor, for facilitating the CEO Speakers Series.
