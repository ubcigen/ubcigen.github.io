### 5. IGEN Space cleanup

This year the first year's clubroom crawl will be taking place the day after Industry Night. This means that we need our space to be sparkling clean before Industry Night begins. As part of your requirements before setting up for Industry Night we will need the IGEN Clubroom, shop, and electrical room to be spotless. This means everyone must do their part to help clean up everything. You WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO SET UP UNTIL EVERYTHING IS CLEAN. More details will be released closer to the event.


### 6. Environmental Engineering clothing exchange

Our neighbours the Environmental Engineers are hosting a clothing exchange! Please contact [enveubc@gmail.com](mailto:enveubc@gmail.com) for more information.


Thanks for your attention, and have a wonderful week!
