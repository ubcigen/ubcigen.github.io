Hello everyone!

### 1. IGEN General Meeting

The Integrated Engineering Council will be hosting a General Meeting for all students on Friday, November 20th, from 12:00 - 2:00 PM in CEME 1202. The goals of this meeting are to gain feedback regarding council activities up to this point, and have students discuss plans for next semester. Also discussed will be classes and curriculum, e-week consultation done in conjunction with the EUS, and assorted other IGEN related topics. Refreshments will be provided. Come and have a say in how your program functions!

### 3. Krispy Kreme fundraiser

Krispy Kreme Fundraiser - Help Wanted!

IGEN is growing in numbers each year and we need money to help cover costs for our shop supplies, clubroom, student affairs, and industry outreach. We will be setting up a booth in the Kaiser Atrium from November 23  - 26 (11 am - 2 pm everyday) and will be selling Krispy Kreme donuts for cheap:

$10/dozen, $1/single donut

Help booth, sell donuts and spread the word about IGEN! If you got 30mins to spare, or even more, help would be greatly appreciated! Sign up sheet will be posted on the bulletin in the clubroom.
